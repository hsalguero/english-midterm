        <h1>Pre-Colonial Influences</h1>
        <h2>God</h2>
        <p>One of the major reasons for people coming to America during pre-colonial times was religious persecution. The Pilgrims originally came to America because they wanted to practice their own religion without fear of being persecuted or punished for it. These Puritans were strict followers of the Bible, and while they sought religious freedom, they did not allow religious freedom within their sect. The first groups of Puritans had hoped to create a “holy” community in New England, and eventually grow it into something bigger as they kept settling (Danzer, 49).</p>
        <h2>Gold</h2>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest reason for people settling in the Americas was money. Whether it was trading or selling, money was a driving force when it came to getting the colonies off the ground. Nicolas Perrot made friends with the native peoples and wanted to gain a reputation through trade. “On one occasion, among the Pouteouatemis, he was regarded as a god. Curiosity induced him to form the acquaintance of this nation, who dwelt at the foot of the Bay of Puans”(La Potherie, 3). This shows how the colonists and settlers wanted to make money in their new settlements and find better economic opportunities than what they had back in Europe.</p>
        <h2>Glory</h2>
        <p>Several people were looking for glory in the Americas. People who came to settle and colonize wanted to form friendships and acquaintances while also helping their own status and forming strong relationships to prevent conflict. Nicolas Perrot was also looking for this kind of renown. It was through his agency that the Mississippi became known. He rendered very important services to the colony, made known the glory of the king among those peoples, and induced them to form an alliance with him and his people (La Potherie, 1). The settlers had this attitude where they wanted to make acquaintances with the natives and other peoples to aid them in their quest for becoming more powerful in these new lands.</p>
        <h2>Modern</h2>
        <p>These three driving principles are still present in modern society, with religion being a big reason people still come here to this day. One example of this is women from Muslim countries fleeing to America to escape persecution for refusing to adhere to the extreme laws of their religion. Money is also a big thing in modern America, with our capitalist society being one of the most competitive economies in the world. Everyone wants to make money, and that mentality has stayed true from the very beginning. Present day America is also a nation of glory, depending on who you ask. With it being one of the largest superpowers on the planet, it is not hard to see what kind of attitude was necessary to get to this point. These three core values have stayed true for hundreds of years, and there is evidence for each of them in our current society.</p>
